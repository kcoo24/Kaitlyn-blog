    "text": "Introduction\nThe Project\nThis project is based on the Hospital Dataset from the The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets (CORGIS). The dataset includes information on the names, locations, average ratings, mortality rates, and average procedure costs, among other variables.\nTo better understand the varying experiences with healthcare across the Unites States, this project compares the quality and cost of medical procedures of hospitals in California and Wyoming. While they may appear to be a random pairing of states, California and Wyoming were chosen because of their designation as the most populous (CA) and least populous (WY) states.\nContext and Motivation\nAccess to healthcare in the United States is not a new issue, but it has been recently stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As asserted by the National Library of Medicine, there are significant disparities in access to healthcare based on race and ethnicity. Drawing on the CORGIS dataset, this project seeks to discover if other barriers to heathcare exist such as price and quality of medical attention.\nI do not have prior experience working with healthcare data, nor am I particularly interested in the world of medicine. That said, the past few years of living through the COVID-19 pandemic have sparked my interest in uncovering the disparities felt within the healthcare system.\nKey Terms\nThe dataset divides U.S. hospitals into three categories: government, private, and proprietary. Government hospitals are those –as the name suggest– that are owned and funded by the government. They are public entities and operate off of money collected for taxes. Private hospitals are not affiliated with the government, instead run by corporations. They can be book non-profit and for-profit. Lastly, proprietary hospitals are for-profit institutions also run by individual corporations or specific government entities.\nPreliminary Research Questions 1. Is there a correlation between medical costs and the quality of treatment?\n\nDoes the type of hospital (government, private, or proprietary) impact medical costs and the quality of treatment?\n\nData

rating, safety rating, readmission rating, and experience rating are based on a comparison to the national averages. While on one hand this limits the credibility of the dataset because the raw numbers are not presented, as it forces the viewer to rely on the creator’s analysis, it also streamlines the dataset. The viewer learns much more about a hospital by reading that it is “Above” the national rating for safety than they would from reading over the equivalent numerical value.\n\nhospital_df.columns\n\nIndex(['Facility.Name', 'Facility.City', 'Facility.State', 'Facility.Type',\n       'Rating.Overall', 'Rating.Mortality', 'Rating.Safety',\n       'Rating.Readmission', 'Rating.Experience', 'Rating.Effectiveness',\n       'Rating.Timeliness', 'Rating.Imaging', 'Procedure.Heart Attack.Cost',\n       'Procedure.Heart Attack.Quality', 'Procedure.Heart Attack.Value',\n       'Procedure.Heart Failure.Cost', 'Procedure.Heart Failure.Quality',\n       'Procedure.Heart Failure.Value', 'Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost',\n       'Procedure.Pneumonia.Quality', 'Procedure.Pneumonia.Value',\n       'Procedure.Hip Knee.Cost', 'Procedure.Hip Knee.Quality',\n       'Procedure.Hip Knee.Value'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\nhospital_df.describe(include='all')\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Facility.Name\n      Facility.City\n      Facility.State\n      Facility.Type\n      Rating.Overall\n      Rating.Mortality\n      Rating.Safety\n      Rating.Readmission\n      Rating.Experience\n      Rating.Effectiveness\n      ...\n      Procedure.Heart Attack.Value\n      Procedure.Heart Failure.Cost\n      Procedure.Heart Failure.Quality\n      Procedure.Heart Failure.Value\n      Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost\n      Procedure.Pneumonia.Quality\n      Procedure.Pneumonia.Value\n      Procedure.Hip Knee.Cost\n      Procedure.Hip Knee.Quality\n      Procedure.Hip Knee.Value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      count\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772.000000\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772\n      ...\n      4772\n      4772.000000\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772.000000\n      4772\n      4772\n      4772.000000\n      4772\n      4772\n    \n    \n      unique\n      4589\n      2929\n      56\n      5\n      NaN\n      4\n      4\n      4\n      4\n      4\n      ...\n      4\n      NaN\n      4\n      4\n      NaN\n      4\n      4\n      NaN\n      4\n      4\n    \n    \n      top\n      Memorial Hospital\n      Chicago\n      TX\n      Private\n      NaN\n      Same\n      None\n      Above\n      None\n      Same\n      ...\n      Unknown\n      NaN\n      Average\n      Average\n      NaN\n      Average\n      Average\n      NaN\n      Average\n      Unknown\n    \n    \n      freq\n      15\n      29\n      403\n      2078\n      NaN\n      2663\n      2142\n      1508\n      1340\n      3372\n      ...\n      2506\n      NaN\n      3141\n      2522\n      NaN\n      3555\n      2338\n      NaN\n      2615\n      2045\n    \n    \n      mean\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      2.179380\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      12149.034367\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      14625.655071\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      12501.068525\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      std\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      1.935582\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      7502.579223\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      6598.128266\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      10997.181810\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      min\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      -1.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      25%\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      1.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      15169.500000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      50%\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      3.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      15921.500000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      16933.500000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      19120.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      75%\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      4.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      17126.500000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      18245.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      21985.500000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      max\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      5.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      ...\n      NaN\n      22450.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      27126.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      42546.000000\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n  \n\n11 rows × 24 columns\n\n\n\nWhile it is interesting to view a statistical representation of all hospitals across the U.S., it is difficult to make meaningful conclusions with so many entries.
